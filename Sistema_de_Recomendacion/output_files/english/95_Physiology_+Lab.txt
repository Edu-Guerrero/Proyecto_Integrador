This course analyzes the ways in which living beings respond and adjust physiologically to the conditions imposed by the physical environment that surrounds them. This analysis will be carried out both in ecological (present) and evolutionary time, under the underlying hypothesis that these responses constitute adaptive responses, the result of the action of natural selection. In the course we will focus on the ecological physiology of living beings. The emphasis of the course is fundamentally on the level of the individual organism, although in certain aspects (i.e., energetics), we will also analyze the levels of populations and ecosystems. We will focus on ecological problems that demand a physiological response; organisms are used as examples, they are “models”, of what could be considered an ecological guild rather than a taxonomic group.
