This course teaches the techniques for extracting knowledge from large volumes of
data. Students work with classification, clustering, and data analysis algorithms to solve real-world
problems. Case studies and hands-on projects are included that allow students to apply the techniques learned in real-world situations, improving their ability to make data-driven decisions.
