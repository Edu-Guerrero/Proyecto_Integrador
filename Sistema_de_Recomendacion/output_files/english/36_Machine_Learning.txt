This course delves into machine learning techniques, including supervised 
and unsupervised models and neural networks. Students implement classification and prediction 
algorithms in practical projects. Advanced topics such as deep learning, processing large volumes of data, and 
model evaluation are covered. The course prepares students to apply machine learning 
techniques to real-world problems.
