Introductory course on the principles of electronics. Circuits, electronic components, and their application in basic devices are studied. The laboratory allows experimentation with simple circuits and their analysis. Students will learn to design and build basic electronic circuits, understand the operation of components such as resistors, capacitors, and transistors, and use electronic measurement tools.
