Introduction to the basic concepts of linear algebra, including matrices, 
determinants, vectors, and vector spaces. Practical exercises are included to apply these concepts 
to engineering and science problems. Students will learn to solve systems of linear equations, 
perform linear transformations, and understand the theory of vector spaces.
