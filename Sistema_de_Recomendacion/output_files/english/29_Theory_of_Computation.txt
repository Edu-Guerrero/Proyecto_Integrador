This course covers the theoretical foundations of computation, including 
automata, formal languages, grammars, and complexity theory. Students develop a 
deep understanding of the limits of computability. Advanced topics such as decidability, 
reducibility, and complexity classes are explored, preparing students to tackle complex 
problems in computation.
