Students learn to design complex systems through requirements analysis, 
system modeling, and prototyping. The focus is on creating efficient, scalable, and adaptable 
systems. The course includes the use of modeling and simulation tools, and projects are conducted in which 
students apply design principles to real-world problems, from conception to implementation.
