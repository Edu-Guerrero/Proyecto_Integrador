This course covers the implementation and analysis of data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Students apply these concepts in programming projects to optimize the performance of algorithms. The importance of choosing the appropriate data structure for different types of problems is emphasized, and case studies are included to illustrate practical applications.
