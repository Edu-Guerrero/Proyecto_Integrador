The second internship provides students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge 
in a real educational setting. Under the supervision of a teacher, students will take on increased responsibilities 
in the classroom, actively participating in lesson planning and implementation. Students are expected 
to develop advanced pedagogical skills and reflect on their teaching practice.
