Continuation of the Engineering Physics 1 course, this course covers 
topics such as electromagnetism, electric circuits, and waves. It includes a laboratory component for the 
practical application of theoretical concepts. Students will perform experiments to understand the 
behavior of electric circuits, the magnetic field, and the properties of waves.
