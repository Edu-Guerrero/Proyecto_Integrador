The Evolution course provides a deep understanding of the mechanisms and processes that have shaped the diversity of life on Earth. Students will explore topics such as the theory of evolution by natural selection, population genetics, speciation, and coevolution. Fossil and molecular evidence supporting evolutionary theory will be analyzed, as well as patterns of evolution in different lineages. In addition, the course includes case studies and current examples of evolution in action, providing a modern and applied perspective. Students will engage in hands-on activities and research projects that will allow them to apply the concepts learned and develop skills in the analysis of evolutionary data. This course is fundamental for those interested in biology, ecology, genetics, and other life sciences, providing a solid foundation for advanced study and careers in these areas.
